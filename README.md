2D Unity C# simple dark souls clone

2D-Top Down Perspective

Small solo (so far) project that I started with the purpose of learning C# and exploring the process of 
 designing/programming games.
 
 -Scripts-
 
-camera can follow one or two gameobjects. If two, will position itself to be in the middle of both, to a max/min size

-player movement (general movements, able to roll (with invincibility frames), attack)

-enemy tracking movement (basically chase a gameobject until in range, then attack. Will flinch if being attacked)
